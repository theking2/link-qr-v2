<h1>IMPRESSUM</h1>
<h2>go321</h2>
<p>Two things are going on here. We take your url and turn it into something shorter. Second you get a QR code from for this shorter link. As our base URL is really short the QR code is real simple. Think bitly but without the commerce. Something short can be scanned from a far distance. A presentation or something. Also you can change that URL to something else. A bit dodgy, but don't play the rules, we will report to law enforcement if you are evil. We assume you're not.</p>
<h3>who are we</h3>
<p><span class="go321">go321</span> is independent and we do not collect any data on you, we couldn´t care less.</p>
<h3>How this works</h3>
<p>We do store your email and password if you sign up. We do store the links you create. That what this is basically.
  We do not care what links and the content is your responsibility.</p>
<p>Log files are created and deleted after three months. </p>
<p>Our service will be free and online as far we can control it. Short links will not be reused and will be available as long as we exist.</p>
<h3>Why we are here</h3>
<p>As we believe in free stuff, there are no creepy third party trackers here. We don´t collect data other than the short codes and the url and the number of times a link was used.</p>
<p>We don´t care what you store and are not responsible for links you have stored here. We might have to disclose to law enforcement your email if you store something completely dodgy and disable the link. Please don't do dodgy.</p>
<h3>Contact</h3>
<p>contact me on info@go321.ch if something extraodinarily is going on. Or if you want your own private shortener (free for people I like)</p>
<p>BTW links might be removed if someone does not like them. You will not be notified of this, but the short code will not be reused. (Let me know, with reason, why we should scrap a short code)</p>
<h3>Where are we</h3>
<p>This service is hosted in Switzerland with metanet.ch if you are interested. We do like everyone in the world but not to share data with in multiple datacenters. metanet is green enough to our taste</p>
<h3>The source</h3>
<p>In case you are interested our source code is <a href="https://github.com/theking2/link-qr/">here</a>. Feel free to scrutinize and reused it. A note if you do so would be nice</p>
